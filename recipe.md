Recipe:
1.) In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
2.) Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
3.) Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix).
4.) Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense flavor, chill the dough overnight.
5.) Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6.) Scoop the dough onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
7.) Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
8.) Cool completely before serving.
Enjoy!
